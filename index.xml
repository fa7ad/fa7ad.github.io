GitHub LinkedIn I&amp;rsquo;m a Software Engineer from Dhaka, Bangladesh. I specialize in creating performant and scalable reactive web apps using React and Node. I&amp;rsquo;m currently working at Digital Healthcare Solutions (formerly Telenor Health). I&amp;rsquo;m also in the process of completing my undergrad at AIUB. I enjoy learning about new technology (languages/frameworks/libraries/syntax&amp;hellip;) and I&amp;rsquo;m usually willing to pay the early-adopter tax if I think the tech is awesome.</description></item></channel></rss>
