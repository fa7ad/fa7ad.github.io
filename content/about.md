I'm a Software Engineer from Dhaka, Bangladesh. I specialize in creating performant and scalable reactive web apps using React and Node. I'm currently working at [Digital Healthcare Solutions (formerly Telenor Health)](https://dh.health). I'm also in the process of completing my undergrad at [AIUB](https://aiub.edu). I enjoy learning about new technology (languages/frameworks/libraries/syntax...) and I'm usually willing to pay the early-adopter tax if I think the tech is awesome.

- 📝 I ~~regularly~~ write articles on [mildlyboring.com](https://mildlyboring.com) and [dev.to](https://dev.to/fa7ad)
