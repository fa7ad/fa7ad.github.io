## Hi 👋, I'm Fahad

I'm a Software Engineer from Dhaka, Bangladesh; living in Munich, Germany. I specialize in creating performant and scalable reactive web apps using React and Node. I'm currently working as a _Software Frontend Engineer_ at [Westwing Commercial GmbH](https://www.westwing.com/home). I enjoy learning about new technology (languages/frameworks/libraries/syntax…) and I'm usually willing to pay the early-adopter tax if I think the tech is awesome.
