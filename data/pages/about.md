## Glad to see you here!

I'm a Software Engineer from Bangladesh; living in Berlin, Germany.
I'm working as a _Senior Frontend Developer_ at [Virtual Minds] at the moment, formerly employed at [@aws], [Westwing], [Digital Health][dh], and a few other places.

I make web apps using [React] and stuff. I enjoy learning about new technology (languages/frameworks/libraries/syntax…) and I'm usually willing to pay the [early-adopter tax][2] if the tech is awesome.

## Rapidfire

- 🔭 **I'm currently "working" on:** Producing more music ~~and [Mildly Boring (my blog)][blog]~~
- 🌱 **I'm currently learning:** [ent] and [go]
- 👯 **I'm looking to collaborate on:** a techno track (PS. send me your samples 😁)
- 💬 **Ask me about:** **react, redux, ramda, js, functional programming, and music**.
- 📝 **I _<sup><sub>very occassionally</sub></sup>_ write articles on:** my blog [mildlyboring.com][blog] and [dev.to/fa7ad][devto-link].
- 🔥 **Hot Take:** _coffee is the best beverage mankind has ever created_.
- 📫 **How to reach me:** shoot a mail at _setname.fahad AT gmail.com_.
- 💅 **Pronouns:** He/Him/His.

## My Hobbies and Interests

- Listening to **music**: My current favorite genres are Industrial Techno, Vaporwave, and hyperpop, but my favorite genres are always ch-ch-changing 😁.
- **Making** <sup><sub>(not necessarily good)</sub></sup> **music:** self-taught, play the guitar a little, slightly better on the keyboard. I mostly make music using a DAW (Logic Pro X) and a MIDI controller (Akai MPK Mini MKIII). Currently working on a techno/techno-adjacent track. I'm also into sampling, so if you have any samples you want to share, hit me up 😁. Also, check out my [Spotify][spotify-profile-link].
- **Reading:** non-fiction, fantasy, science fiction, etc. Currently reading _Heaven in Disorder_ by **Slavoj Žižek**.
- Watching **Movies**: mostly into Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Action (sometimes its fun to shut off the brain), and _Gaspar Noé_'s weird shit (no idea what that genre is, if there is one).
- **Playing games**: I'm into single player games that have a good "story" component (like RDR), don't really get the time/energy to play multiplayer games.
- **Hiking**: Not an expert by any means, more of a fair-weather hiker. Bavarian pre-alps were super fun, but now this is on semi-permanent hold because Berlin is flat as a pancake.
- **Tinkering** with software/hardware in my spare time. I will spend hours to automate a 5 min task, simply because its fun.
