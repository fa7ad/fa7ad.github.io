## Glad to see you here!

I'm a Software Engineer from Bangladesh; living in Berlin, Germany. I make web apps using React and stuff; currently working as a _Front-end Engineer_ at [Amazon Web Services](https://github.com/aws).
I enjoy learning about new technology (languages/frameworks/libraries/syntax…) and I'm usually willing to pay the early-adopter tax if the tech is awesome.

## My Hobbies and Interests

- **Listening to music:** Current favorite genres are Dark Techno, Gabber, and hyperpop, but my favorite genres are always ch-ch-changing 😁.
- **Making** <sup><sub>(not necessarily good)</sub></sup> **music:** self-taught, play the guitar a little, slightly better on the keyboard. I mostly make music using a DAW (Logic Pro X) and a MIDI controller (Akai MPK Mini MKIII). Currently working on a techno/techno-adjacent track. I'm also into sampling, so if you have any samples you want to share, hit me up 😁. Also, check out my [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/25audC4pnujjgECEKlxLIK?si=NzkTP_zATWu5Ry-VkdBS7A).
- **Reading:** mostly into non-fiction, but I'm also into fantasy and science fiction. Currently reading _Heaven in Disorder_ by **Slavoj Žižek**.
- **Watching Movies:** mostly into Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Action (sometimes its fun), and Gaspar Noé's weird shit (no idea what that genre is, if there is one).
- **Playing games:** I'm into single player storytelling games (like RDR, for example), don't really get the time to play multiplayer games.
- **Hiking:** Not an expert by any means, more of a fair-weather hiker. Bavarian pre-alps were super fun, but now this is on semi-permanent hold because Berlin is flat as a pancake.
- Tinkering with software/hardware (I will spend hours to automate a 5 min task, because its fun)
