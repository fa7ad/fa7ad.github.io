# Hi 👋, I'm Fahad ([/fähæð/][1])

[ ![devto][devto-badge]][devto-link] [ ![BlueSky][bsky-badge]][bsky-link] [ ![linkedin][linkedin-badge]][linkedin-link]

## Glad to see you here!

I'm a Software Engineer<sup>\*</sup> from 🇧🇩; living in Berlin 🇩🇪.

I'm working as a _Senior Frontend Developer_ at [Virtual Minds] at the moment, formerly employed at [aws], [Westwing], [Digital Health][dh], and a few other places.

I don't believe in sticking to one tech stack. That said, I'm most experienced at making web apps using [React], [Node], and (more recently) [Go].
I enjoy learning about new technology (languages/frameworks/libraries/syntax…) and I'm usually willing to try out new ideas and even pay the [early-adopter tax][2] if the tech seems awesome.

## Rapidfire

- 🔭 **I'm currently "working" on:** Producing more music
- 🌱 **I'm currently learning:** _working on a kubernetes certification_
- 👯 **I'm looking to collaborate on:** music, OSS
- 💬 **Ask me about:** **react, frontend, js, fp, go, and music**.
- 📝 **I _<sup><sub>almost never</sub></sup>_ write articles on:** my blog [mildlyboring.com][blog] and [dev.to/fa7ad][devto-link].
- 🔥 **Hot Take:** _coffee is the best beverage mankind has ever created_.
- 📫 **How to reach me:** shoot a mail at _setname.fahad AT gmail.com_.
- 💅 **Pronouns:** He/Him/His.

## My Hobbies and Interests

- **Making** <sup><sub>(not necessarily good)</sub></sup> **music:** self-taught, play the guitar a little, slightly better on the keyboard. I mostly make music on a DAW and a MIDI controller. See the [music page] for links.
- Listening to **music**: my current favorite genres are Hardgroove, "Disco"-y House, and Trap. Always on rotation.
- **Reading:** mostly non-fiction nowadays
- **Tinkering** with software/hardware in my spare time. I will spend hours to automate a 5 min task, simply because its fun.
